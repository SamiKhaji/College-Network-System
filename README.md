In today's dynamic educational landscape, colleges face the challenge of creating a robust and scalable network infrastructure that can meet the diverse communication and collaboration needs of different departments, students, and faculty members.

Problem: The current state of many college network lacks a well-organized and optimized LAN topology as we see many server problems occur during accessing websites etc,, This deficiency leads to inefficiencies in communication, resource sharing, and administrative functions. The absence of a cohesive network design hinders the seamless exchange of data and information between departments, impacting collaboration and the overall efficiency of academic and administrative processes.

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement an optimized LAN topology for our college network, addressing the identified issues. This includes enhancing interdepartmental communication, improving resource sharing, strengthening security measures, streamlining administrative processes
